        <p>This is the foundation of our project, with pure HTML and JS (attached directly inside the HTML files).</p>
        <p>It certainly looks bad, but it has all the core functionalities, and we can perfect it together as a team in the future.</p>
        <p>This is the welcome page that should show our logo for a few seconds, and then jump to our homepage.</p>
        <p>For now, please press this button below to enter the homepage.</p>
        <button onclick="enter_homepage()">homepage</button>
